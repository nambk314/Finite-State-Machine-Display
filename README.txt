HOW TO USE FSM DISPLAY:

S: create node
E: Click on the node/edge to edit the label
T: create edge (Click on 1 node and then click on the other node to create edge)
C: nothing
D: drag
A: change accepting node
H: set the start node

Press the key and follow with the mouse click behavior to control the FSM
(EX: Click S and then click on the screen => create a node)

Traverse: 

Click on simulate and a type box will pop up
type in words in this format: a,o,p 
Each letter should be separate by a comma (if there is only one letter you don’t need a comma, I believe)
When you click Ok, the string you type in will be shown in the entered string
to traverse through each string, you click “next”.
